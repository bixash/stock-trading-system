# Stock Trading System with Automated Order Trigger

## Introduction

Stock Trading System with the implementation of Automated Order Triggers (AOT). This project simulates a real broker and exchange system, integrating real-time market data and algorithmic strategies to execute trades based on predefined criteria. This enhances efficiency and reduces human error. The system leverages WebSocket for live data streaming, REST APIs for secure communication, and message queues for sending and receiving orders and trade information between brokers and exchanges.
